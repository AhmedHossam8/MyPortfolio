            <h3>Experience</h3>
            <p>
                I am currently an ITI trainee, developing my skills as a Full-Stack Developer. I am gaining hands-on
                experience
                in frontend and backend technologies, building web applications, and working with tools like React,
                Node.js,
                Django, and databases, while strengthening my problem-solving and collaborative abilities.
            </p>

            <p>
                Previously, I completed an internship at ITWorx, where I contributed to a mobile AI-based comic app.
                I gained experience in Android development using Kotlin and Android Studio, as well as Flutter for
                cross-platform development, applying my knowledge to real-world projects and integrating AI-driven
                features.

            <h3>Academic Journey</h3>
            <p>
                During my time at the Arab Academy for Science, Technology & Maritime Transport, I topped my class for
                two consecutive semesters.
                I also participated in the ECPC competition, where I applied my problem-solving skills and collaborated
                with like-minded peers.
            </p>
            <p>
                I graduated with a GPA of 3.3, earning the "Very Good with Honors" distinction.

                style="color: white;">
            <p>
                Alongside my studies, I worked as a Problem Solving and Data Structure Instructor, preparing students
                for programming competitions such as ECPC. It was a fulfilling experience to help students hone their
                skills and excel in their academic challenges.
            </p>
            <p>
                For my graduation project, I developed a platform using Blockchain and NFTs in Higher Education to
                manage educational credentials. The project received funding from ITIDA, and we proudly secured 3rd
                place in the 6th Olympiad, held at Delta and Damietta universities. Additionally, the project was
                awarded the Computer Science Society Prize for the Best Capstone Project of 2023/2024, highlighting
                its innovation and impact in the field.
